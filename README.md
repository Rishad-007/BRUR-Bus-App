## Data Structure

The bus schedule data is stored in `src/data/busSchedules.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "buses": [
    {
      "id": "route4-8-10am",
      "name": "Route 4 (Campus-DC_Mor-Campus)",
      "Start Time": "8:10am",
      "schedule": [
        { "Time": "8:10", "Stopage": "University Campus" },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

- Each bus entry has a unique `id`, a `name` (route/trip name), a `Start Time`, and a list of stops in `schedule`.
- The app uses a two-step selection: first choose the route/trip name, then select the start time.

## Customization

To add new buses or modify schedules:

1. Edit `src/data/busSchedules.json` (add new objects with `name`, `Start Time`, and `schedule`)
2. Update the TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/bus.ts` if needed (ensure `Start Time` is included)
3. The app will automatically reflect the changes
